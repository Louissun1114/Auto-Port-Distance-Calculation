# Auto-Port-Distance-Calculation
- My point is to easily calculate the distance between two ports.
- One problem I ran into was that the url I used to calculate the distance did not simply use the port name, but a unique portNo.
- As a result, I wrote two .js files. One to get portNo, and another one to get distance using that portNo.
--------------------
- Now I am thinking how to upgrade and combine these two operations...
- To be fully automated, my database must be fully populated and the two file implementations must call each other...ðŸ˜Š
